 * Developer notes: --------------- The "integration" group is important for
 * having tests run properly. It's not actually needed here because it's also
 * defined on the super class. The "ticket:306" group works as a pointer to why
 * certain tests were created, allowing for acceptance test-like functionality
 * (TBD).
 * 
 * It should be noted that server side integration tests DO NOT test the
 * application server in any way. You are using the server-side code as a
 * library at that point and no deployment has been made. (This may change if we
 * start to use an embedded container like the one available from JBoss for
 * testing, in which case there should be an AbstractEmbeddedContextTest)
 * 
 * Also to explain, the AbstractInternalContextTest which is a close parallel to
 * AbstractManagedContextTest is partially deprecated and should only really be
 * used when testing specific parts of the internal plumbing of Omero, Spring,
 * or Hibernate, such as flushing or transactions.
