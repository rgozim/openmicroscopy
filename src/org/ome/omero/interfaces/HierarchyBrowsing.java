    /**
     * Finds the data trees in the Project/Dataset/Image (P/D/I) hierarchy that 
     * contain the specified Images. 
     * <p>This method will look for all the Datasets containing the specified 
     * Images and then for all Projects containing those Datasets.  In the 
     * returned trees, Projects will be represented by {@link ProjectData}
     * objects, Datasets by {@link DatasetData} objects, and Images by
     * {@link ImageData} objects.</p>
     * <p>This method returns a <code>Set</code> with all root nodes that were
     * found.  Every root node is linked to the found objects and so on until
     * the leaf nodes, which are {@link ImageData} objects.  Note that the type
     * of any root node in the returned set can be {@link ProjectData}, 
     * {@link DatasetData}, or {@link ImageData}.</p>
     * <p>For example, say that you pass in the ids of six Images: <code>i1, i2,
     * i3, i4, i5, i6</code>.  If the P/D/I hierarchy in the DB looks like this:
     * </p>
     * <pre>        
     *                __p1__
     *               /      \

     *           i1     i2     i3    i4    i5  i6
     * </pre>
     * <p>Then the returned set will contain <code>p1, d3, i5, i6</code>.  All
     * objects will be properly linked up.</p>
     * <p>Finally, this method will <i>only</i> retrieve the nodes that are 
     * connected in a tree to the specified leaf image nodes.  Back to the
     * previous example, if <code>d1</code> contained image <code>img500</code>,
     * then the returned object would <i>not</i> contain <code>img500</code>.
     * In a similar way, if <code>p1</code> contained <code>ds300</code> and 
     * this dataset weren't linked to any of the <code>i1, i2, i3, i4, i5, i6
     * </code> images, then <code>ds300</code> would <i>not</i> be part of the
     * returned tree rooted by <code>p1</code>.</p>
