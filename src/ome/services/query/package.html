	facilitates the creation of Hibernate Queries and Criteria.
    
	<p>
  	ORM solutions like Hibernate, TopLink, and JDO provide mechanisms for storing
  	queries by name for faster lookups. Producing parameterizable queries, 
  	however, is far more difficult. The <code>query</code> package intends to make
  	writing such queries as easy as possible.
	</p>
  
	<p>
  	Effort has been placed into making certain activities, like walking (and 
  	fetching) OME hierarchies simpler. These queries are used heavily by the 
  	IPojos interface. Also, having this work available in code rather than the
    Strings of previous methods (XML files, Velocity templates, etc.) allows
    for significantly more reuse and easier re-factoring.
	</p>
  
  <p>
  	A second design goal is allowing <em>clients</em> to write queries themselves. 
    Parameters allow for the passing of arbitrary arguments (like named 
    arguments in dynamic languages), and the QueryFactory#lookup mechanism 
    allows for a wide variety of client-definition styles. Probably the most 
    useful is the saving of a QueryDefinition using IUpdate, and the subsequent
    lookup referring to the queryName. (NYI)
  </p>
  
  <h3>Examples</h3>
  
  <code>
    QueryFactory factory = new QueryFactory(new StringQuerySource());
    Query q = factory.lookup("select p from Project p",null);
    List allProjects = (List) iQuery.execute( q );
  </code>

  <code>
    QueryFactory factory = new QueryFactory(new ClassNameSource());
    Query subclassQ = factory.lookup(PojosFindAnnotationsQueryDefinition.class.getName(),
    	new Parameters().addIds(Collections.singleton(1L)).addClass(Image.class));
    Query datasetQ  = factory.lookup(Dataset.class,
    	new Parameters( new Filter().unique() ).addString("name","16.3093-A93"));

    List imageAnnotations = (List) iQuery.execute( subclassQ );
    Dataset dataset = (Dataset) iQuery.execute(datasetQ);
  </code>
