     * Ok, this is doable without shutting down anything, if you either get the
     * SessionFactory via JNDI, or acquire it using spring:
     *  - dynamically create a new class - compile the class using
     * javac.compile(args); - create a <class>.hbm.xml (or just add annotations
     * to the class) - get a handle to the new class with Class clazz =
     * Class.forName(classname); - make up a new SessionFactory, reading in all
     * old and... - ... add the new class to the configuration via
     * cfg.addAnnotatedClass(clazz); - call cfg.buildSessionFactory(); again? -
     * the call to buildSessionFactory makes all necessary updates to the db -
     * replace the old SessionFactory with the new one in jndi/spring - old
     * sessions can still run without the new class until they are committed -
     * new clients get their Sessions from the new SessionFActory, that already
     * supports the new class.
     * 
     * You see, it's not much of a deal:)
     *  - jnlp or at least some url-classloader would be useful for the clients,
     * to make sure they get the proper classes shipped.
     * 
     * The hibernate-folks say it's doable this way, although noone has done
     * this yet.
     * 
     * Cheers stf
