 * it should not be assumed that two subsequent calls to a proxy for this
 * service will go to the same server due to clustering.
 * 
 * Not all possible server configuration is available through this API. Some
 * values (such as DB connection info, ports, etc.) must naturally be set before
 * this service is accessible.
 * 
 * Also used as the main developer example for developing (stateless) ome.api
 * interfaces. See source code documentation for more.
