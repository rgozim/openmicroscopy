/**
 * Provides methods for dealing with the core "Pojos" of OME. Included are:
 * Projects, Datasets, Images, CategoryGroups, Categories, Classifications,
 * ImageAnnotations, and DatasetAnnotations.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The names of the methods correlate to how the function operates:
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>load</b>: start at container objects and work down toward the leaves, 
 * 					returning hierarchy (Proejct-&gt;Dataset-&gt;Image</li>
 * <li><b>find</b>: start at leave objects and work up to containers, returning hierarchy</li>
 * <li><b>get</b>: retrieves only leaves in the hierarchy (currently only Images)</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <h3>Options Mechanism</h3>
 * <p>
 * The options are used to add some constraints to the generic method e.g. load hierarchy 
 * trees images <i>for a given user</i>. This mechanism should give us enough flexibility 
 * to extend the API if necessary, e.g. in some cases we might want to retrieve the images 
 * with or without annotations
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Most methods take such an <code>options</code> map which is built on the
 * client-side using {@link omero.client.OptionBuilder an option builder.} The
 * currently supported options are:
 * <ul>
 * 	<li><b>annotator</b>(Integer): 
 * 	If key exists but value null, annotations are retrieved for all objects in the hierarchy where they exist;
 * 	if a valid experimenterID, annotations are only retrieved for that user. May 
 * 	not be used be all methods.
 * <b>Default: all annotations</b></li>
 * 	<li><b>leaves</b>(Boolean): if FALSE omits images from the returned hierarchy.
 * 	May not be used by all methods. <b>Default: true</b></li>
 * 	<li><b>experimenter</b>(Integer): inables filtering on a per-experimenter basis.
 * 	This option has a method-specific (and possibly context-specific) meaning. Please 
 * 	see the individual methods.</li>
 * </p>

	 * For example, say that you pass in the ids of six Images: <code>i1, i2,
