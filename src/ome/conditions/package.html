Forms the basis of all Omero exception hierarchies. 
  
<p>
  It is intended that no exceptions not subclassing RootException will escape
  the server. A last ditch effort will be made to wrap any unknown exception
  in an InternalException. 
</p>
  
<p>
  Due to networking issues, this will not always be possible, and the client 
  should deal with all non-Omero exceptions as OutOfService exceptions.
</p>
