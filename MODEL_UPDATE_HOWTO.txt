HOW TO UPDATE THE MODEL:
-----------------------

First you'll need to checkout the needed libraries from:

  SUBVERSION/lib/hibernate3 
  SUBVERSION/lib/middlegen

where SUBVERSION is most likely

  http://cvs.openmicroscopy.org.uk/svn/omero

Then from within components/common

   maven middlegen                         # This produces an error; ignore it
   svn revert src/ome/model/Groups.hbm.xml # unless you know what you're doing
   ant -f middlegen/middlegen-build.xml -Dbasedir=`pwd` gen-java
   maven jar:install

Now you can update other projects in Eclipse, etc. and begin working.
