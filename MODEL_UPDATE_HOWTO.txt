HOW TO UPDATE THE MODEL:
-----------------------

First you'll need to checkout the needed libraries from:

  SUBVERSION/lib/htool

where SUBVERSION is most likely

  http://cvs.openmicroscopy.org.uk/svn/omero

to OMERO_HOME/lib. Then from within components/common

   ant 		# This generates various artifacts:
		# * Hibernate mappings (NYI)
		# * Java source files
		# * C# source files
		# * Python files
		# * Etc. as long as your path is properly defined

Now you can update other projects in Eclipse, etc. and begin working.
